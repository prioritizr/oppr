#' Project prioritization problem
#'
#' Create a project prioritization problem. This function is used to
#' specify the underlying data used in a prioritization problem: the projects,
#' the management actions, and the features that need
#' to be conserved (e.g. species, ecosystems). After constructing this
#' `ProjectProblem-class` object,
#' it can be customized using [objectives], [targets],
#' [weights], [constraints], [decisions] and
#' [solvers]. After building the problem, the
#' [solve()] function can be used to identify solutions.
#'
#' @param projects [base::data.frame()] or
#'   [tibble::tibble()] table containing project data. Here, each row
#'   should correspond to a different project and columns should contain data
#'   that correspond to each project. This object should contain data that
#'   denote (i)
#'   the name of each project (specified in the argument to
#'   `project_name_column`), (ii) the
#'   probability that each project will succeed if all of its actions are funded
#'   (specified in the argument to `project_success_column`), (iii)
#'   the enhanced probability that each feature will persist if it
#'   is funded (using a column for each feature),
#'   and (iv) and which actions are associated with which projects
#'   (using a column for each action). This object
#'   must have a baseline project, with a zero cost value, that represents the
#'   probability that each feature will persist if no other conservation
#'   project is funded.
#'   Since each feature is assigned the greatest probability of persistence
#'   given the funded projects in a solution, the combined benefits of multiple
#'   projects can be encoded by creating additional projects that represent
#'   "combined projects". For instance, a habitat restoration project might
#'   cost \$100 and mean that a feature has a 40% chance of persisting, and
#'   a pest eradication project might cost \$50 and mean that a feature has a
#'   60% chance of persisting. Due to non-linear effects, funding both of these
#'   projects might mean that a species has a 90% chance of persistence.
#'   This can be accounted for by creating a third project, representing the
#'   funding of both projects, which costs \$150 and provides a 90% chance
#'   of persistence.
#'
#' @param actions [base::data.frame()] or [tibble::tibble()]
#'   table containing the action data. Here, each row should correspond to a
#'   different action and columns should contain data that correspond to
#'   each action. At a minimum, this object should contain data that denote (i)
#'   the name of each action (specified in the argument to
#'   `action_name_column`), (ii) the cost of each action (specified in the
#'   argument to `action_cost_column`). Optionally, it may also contain
#'   data that indicate actions should be (iii) locked in or (iv) locked
#'   out (see [add_locked_in_constraints()] and
#'   [add_locked_out_constraints()]). It should also contain a
#'   zero-cost baseline action that is associated with the baseline project.
#
#'
#' @param features [base::data.frame()] or
#'   [tibble::tibble()]
#'   table containing the feature data. Here, each row should correspond
#'   to a different feature and columns should contain data that correspond
#'   to each feature. At a minimum, this object should contain data that denote
#'   (i) the name of each feature (specified in the argument to
#'   `feature_name_column`). Optionally, it may also contain (ii) the
#'   weight for each feature or (iii) persistence targets for each feature.
#'
#' @param project_name_column `character` name of column that contains
#'   the name for each conservation project. This argument corresponds to the
#'   `projects` table. Note that the project names must not contain any
#'   duplicates or missing values.
#'
#' @param project_success_column `character` name of column that
#'   indicates the probability that each project will succeed. This argument
#'   corresponds to the argument to `projects` table. This column must have
#'   `numeric` values which range between zero and one. No missing values
#'   are permitted.
#'
#' @param action_name_column `character` name of column that contains
#'   the name for each management action. This argument corresponds to the
#'   `actions` table. Note that the project names must not contain any
#'   duplicates or missing values.
#'
#' @param action_cost_column `character` name of column that
#'   indicates the cost for funding each action. This argument corresponds
#'   to the argument to `actions` table. This column must have
#'   `numeric` values which are equal to or greater than zero. No missing
#'   values are permitted.
#'
#' @param feature_name_column `character` name of the column that contains
#'   the name for each feature. This argument corresponds to the
#'   `feature` table. Note that the feature names must not contain any
#'   duplicates or missing values.
#'
#' @param adjust_for_baseline `logical` should the probability of
#'   features persisting when projects are funded be adjusted to account for the
#'   probability of features persisting under the baseline "do nothing"
#'   scenario in the event that the funded projects fail to succeed?
#'   This should always be `TRUE`, except when funding a project
#'   means that the baseline "do nothing" scenario does not apply if a funded
#'   project fails. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @details
#'   A project prioritization problem has actions, projects,
#'   and features. Features are the biological entities that need to
#'   be conserved (e.g. species, populations, ecosystems). Actions are
#'   real-world management actions that can be implemented to enhance
#'   biodiversity (e.g. habitat restoration, monitoring, pest eradication). Each
#'   action should have a known cost, and this usually means that each
#'   action should have a defined spatial extent and time period (though this
#'   is not necessary). Conservation projects are groups of management actions
#'   (they can also comprise a singular action too), and each project is
#'   associated with a probability of success if all of its associated actions
#'   are funded. To determine which projects should be funded, each project is
#'   associated with an probability of persistence for the
#'   features that they benefit. These values should indicate the
#'   probability that each feature will persist if only that project funded
#'   and not the additional benefit relative to the baseline project. Missing
#'   (`NA`) values should be used to indicate which projects do not
#'   enhance the probability of certain features.
#'
#'   The goal of a project prioritization exercise is then to identify which
#'   management actions---and as a consequence which conservation
#'   projects---should be funded. Broadly speaking, the goal
#'   of an optimization problem is to minimize (or maximize) an objective
#'   function given a set of control variables and decision variables that are
#'   subject to a series of constraints. In the context of project
#'   prioritization problems, the
#'   objective is usually some measure of utility (e.g. the net
#'   probability of each feature persisting into the future), the
#'   control variables determine which actions should be funded or not,
#'   the decision variables contain additional information needed to
#'   ensure correct calculations,  and the
#'   constraints impose limits such as the total budget available for funding
#'   management actions. For more information on the mathematical
#'   formulations used in this package, please refer to the manual entries for
#'   the available objectives (listed in [objectives]).
