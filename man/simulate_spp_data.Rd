Simulate data for species-based prioritizations.

\details{
The simulated data set will contain one conservation project for
  each species and a "baseline" (do nothing) project to reflect species'
  persistence when none of their conservation projects are not funded. Each
  conservation project is associated with a single action, and no
  conservation projects share any actions. Specifically, the data are
  simulated as follows:

  \enumerate{

    \item A conservation project is created for each species, and each
      project is associated with its own single action.

    \item Cost data for each action are simulated using a normal
      distribution and the \code{cost_mean} and \code{cost_sd} arguments.

    \item A set proportion of the actions are randomly set to be locked
      in and out of the solutions using the \code{locked_in_proportion} and
      \code{locked_out_proportion} arguments.

    \item The probability of each project succeeding if its action is funded
      is simulated by drawing probabilities from a uniform distribution with
      the upper and lower bounds set as the \code{success_min_probability}
      and \code{success_max_probability} arguments.

    \item The probability of each species persisting if its project is funded
      and is successful is simulated by drawing probabilities from a uniform
      distribution with the upper and lower bounds set as the
      \code{funded_min_persistence_probability} and
      \code{funded_max_persistence_probability} arguments.

    \item An additional project is created which represents the "baseline"
      (do nothing) scenario. The probability of each species persisting
      when managed under this project is simulated by drawing probabilities
      from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds
      set as the \code{not_funded_min_persistence_probability}
      and \code{not_funded_max_persistence_probability} arguments.

    \item A phylogenetic tree is simulated for the species using
      \code{\link[ape]{rcoal}}.

    \item Species data are created from the phylogenetic tree. The
      weights are calculated as the amount of evolutionary history
      that has elapsed between each species and its last common ancestor.
