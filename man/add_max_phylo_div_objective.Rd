\description{
Set the objective of a project prioritization \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to
maximize the phylogenetic diversity that is expected to persist into the
future, whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a
pre-specified budget (Bennett \emph{et al.} 2014, Faith 2008).
}
\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
project prioritization problem.
Here, the maximum phylogenetic diversity objective seeks to find the set
of actions that maximizes the expected amount of evolutionary history
that is expected to persist into the future given the evolutionary
relationships between the features (e.g. populations, species).
Let \eqn{I} represent the set of conservation actions (indexed by
\eqn{i}). Let \eqn{C_i} denote the cost for funding action \eqn{i}, and
let \eqn{m} denote the maximum expenditure (i.e. the budget). Also,
let \eqn{F} represent each feature (indexed by \eqn{f}), \eqn{W_f}
represent the weight for each feature \eqn{f} (defaults to zero for
each feature unless specified otherwise), and \eqn{E_f}
denote the probability that each feature will go extinct given the funded
conservation projects.

To describe the
evolutionary relationships between the features \eqn{f \in F}{f in F},
consider a phylogenetic tree that contains features \eqn{f \in F}{f in F}
with branches of known lengths. This tree can be described using
mathematical notation by letting \eqn{B} represent the branches (indexed by
\eqn{b}) with lengths \eqn{L_b} and letting \eqn{T_{bf}} indicate which
features \eqn{f \in F}{f in F} are associated with which phylogenetic
branches \eqn{b \in B}{b in B} using zeros and ones. Ideally, the set of
features \eqn{F} would contain all of the species in the study
area---including non-threatened species---to fully account for the benefits
for funding different actions.

To guide the prioritization, the conservation actions are organized into
conservation projects. Let \eqn{J} denote the set of conservation projects
(indexed by \eqn{j}), and let \eqn{A_{ij}} denote which actions
\eqn{i \in I}{i in I} comprise each conservation project
\eqn{j \in J}{j in J} using zeros and ones. Next, let \eqn{P_j} represent
the probability of project \eqn{j} being successful if it is funded. Also,
let \eqn{B_{fj}} denote the enhanced probability that each feature
\eqn{f \in F}{f in F} associated with the project \eqn{j \in J}{j in J}
will persist if all of the actions that comprise project \eqn{j} are funded
and that project is allocated to feature \eqn{f}.
For convenience,
let \eqn{Q_{fj}} denote the actual probability that each
\eqn{f \in F}{f in F} associated with the project \eqn{j \in J}{j in J}
is expected to persist if the project is funded. If the argument
to \code{adjust_for_baseline} in the \code{problem} function was set to
\code{TRUE}, and this is the default behavior, then
\eqn{Q_{fj} = (P_{j} \times B_{fj}) + \bigg(\big(1 - (P_{j} B_{fj})\big)
  \times (P_{n} \times B_{fn})\bigg)}{Q_{fj} = (P_j B_{fj}) + ((1 - (P_j
  B_{fj})) * (P_n \times B_{fn}))}, where \code{n} corresponds to the
baseline "do nothing" project. This means that the probability
of a feature persisting if a project is allocated to a feature
depends on (i) the probability of the project succeeding, (ii) the
probability of the feature persisting if the project does not fail,
and (iii) the probability of the feature persisting even if the project
fails. Otherwise, if the argument is set to \code{FALSE}, then
\eqn{Q_{fj} = P_{j} \times B_{fj}}{Q_{fj} = P_{j} * B_{fj}}.

The binary control variables \eqn{X_i} in this problem indicate whether
each project \eqn{i \in I}{i in I} is funded or not. The decision
variables in this problem are the \eqn{Y_{j}}, \eqn{Z_{fj}}, \eqn{E_f},
and \eqn{R_b} variables.
Specifically, the binary \eqn{Y_{j}} variables indicate if project \eqn{j}
is funded or not based on which actions are funded; the binary
\eqn{Z_{fj}} variables indicate if project \eqn{j} is used to manage
feature \eqn{f} or not; the semi-continuous \eqn{E_f} variables
denote the probability that feature \eqn{f} will go extinct; and
the semi-continuous \eqn{R_b} variables denote the probability that
phylogenetic branch \eqn{b} will remain in the future.

Now that we have defined all the data and variables, we can formulate
the problem. For convenience, let the symbol used to denote each set also
represent its cardinality (e.g. if there are ten features, let \eqn{F}
represent the set of ten features and also the number ten).

  }

The objective (eqn 1a) is to maximize the expected phylogenetic diversity
(Faith 2008) plus the probability each feature will remain multiplied
by their weights (noting that the feature weights default to zero).
Constraint (eqn 1b) limits the maximum expenditure (i.e.
ensures that the cost of the funded actions do not exceed the budget).
Constraints (eqn 1c) calculate the probability that each branch
(including tips that correspond to a single feature) will go extinct
according to the probability that the features which share a given
branch will go extinct.
Constraints (eqn 1d) calculate the probability that each feature
will go extinct according to their allocated project.
Constraints (eqn 1e) ensure that feature can only be allocated to projects
that have all of their actions funded. Constraints (eqn 1f) state that each
feature can only be allocated to a single project. Constraints (eqn 1g)
ensure that a project cannot be funded unless all of its actions are funded.
Constraints (eqns 1h) ensure that the probability variables
(\eqn{E_f}) are bounded between zero and one. Constraints (eqns 1i) ensure
that the action funding (\eqn{X_i}), project funding (\eqn{Y_j}), and
project allocation (\eqn{Z_{fj}}) variables are binary.

Although this formulation is a mixed integer quadratically constrained
programming problem (due to eqn 1c), it can be approximated using
linear terms and then solved using commercial mixed integer programming
solvers. This can be achieved by substituting the product of the feature
extinction probabilities (eqn 1c) with the sum of the log feature extinction
probabilities and using piecewise linear approximations (described in
Hillier & Price 2005 pp. 390--392) to approximate the exponent of this term.
