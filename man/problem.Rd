\arguments{
\item{projects}{\code{\link[base:data.frame]{base::data.frame()}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} table containing project data. Here, each row
should correspond to a different project and columns should contain data
that correspond to each project. This object should contain data that
denote (i)
the name of each project (specified in the argument to
\code{project_name_column}), (ii) the
probability that each project will succeed if all of its actions are funded
(specified in the argument to \code{project_success_column}), (iii)
the enhanced probability that each feature will persist if it
is funded (using a column for each feature),
and (iv) and which actions are associated with which projects
(using a column for each action). This object
must have a baseline project, with a zero cost value, that represents the
probability that each feature will persist if no other conservation
project is funded.
Since each feature is assigned the greatest probability of persistence
given the funded projects in a solution, the combined benefits of multiple
projects can be encoded by creating additional projects that represent
"combined projects". For instance, a habitat restoration project might
cost $100 and mean that a feature has a 40\% chance of persisting, and
a pest eradication project might cost $50 and mean that a feature has a
60\% chance of persisting. Due to non-linear effects, funding both of these
projects might mean that a species has a 90\% chance of persistence.
This can be accounted for by creating a third project, representing the
funding of both projects, which costs $150 and provides a 90\% chance
of persistence.}

\item{actions}{\code{\link[base:data.frame]{base::data.frame()}} or \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}}
table containing the action data. Here, each row should correspond to a
different action and columns should contain data that correspond to
each action. At a minimum, this object should contain data that denote (i)
the name of each action (specified in the argument to
\code{action_name_column}), (ii) the cost of each action (specified in the
argument to \code{action_cost_column}). Optionally, it may also contain
data that indicate actions should be (iii) locked in or (iv) locked
out (see \code{\link[=add_locked_in_constraints]{add_locked_in_constraints()}} and
\code{\link[=add_locked_out_constraints]{add_locked_out_constraints()}}). It should also contain a
zero-cost baseline action that is associated with the baseline project.}

\item{features}{\code{\link[base:data.frame]{base::data.frame()}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}}
table containing the feature data. Here, each row should correspond
to a different feature and columns should contain data that correspond
to each feature. At a minimum, this object should contain data that denote
(i) the name of each feature (specified in the argument to
\code{feature_name_column}). Optionally, it may also contain (ii) the
weight for each feature or (iii) persistence targets for each feature.}

\item{project_name_column}{\code{character} name of column that contains
the name for each conservation project. This argument corresponds to the
\code{projects} table. Note that the project names must not contain any
duplicates or missing values.}

\item{project_success_column}{\code{character} name of column that
indicates the probability that each project will succeed. This argument
corresponds to the argument to \code{projects} table. This column must have
\code{numeric} values which range between zero and one. No missing values
are permitted.}

\item{action_name_column}{\code{character} name of column that contains
the name for each management action. This argument corresponds to the
\code{actions} table. Note that the project names must not contain any
duplicates or missing values.}

\item{action_cost_column}{\code{character} name of column that
indicates the cost for funding each action. This argument corresponds
to the argument to \code{actions} table. This column must have
\code{numeric} values which are equal to or greater than zero. No missing
values are permitted.}

\item{feature_name_column}{\code{character} name of the column that contains
the name for each feature. This argument corresponds to the
\code{feature} table. Note that the feature names must not contain any
duplicates or missing values.}

\item{adjust_for_baseline}{\code{logical} should the probability of
features persisting when projects are funded be adjusted to account for the
probability of features persisting under the baseline "do nothing"
scenario in the event that the funded projects fail to succeed?
This should always be \code{TRUE}, except when funding a project
means that the baseline "do nothing" scenario does not apply if a funded
project fails. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\description{
Create a project prioritization problem. This function is used to
specify the underlying data used in a prioritization problem: the projects,
the management actions, and the features that need
to be conserved (e.g. species, ecosystems). After constructing this
\code{ProjectProblem-class} object,
it can be customized using \link{objectives}, \link{targets},
\link{weights}, \link{constraints}, \link{decisions} and
\link{solvers}. After building the problem, the
\code{\link[=solve]{solve()}} function can be used to identify solutions.
}
\details{
A project prioritization problem has actions, projects,
and features. Features are the biological entities that need to
be conserved (e.g. species, populations, ecosystems). Actions are
real-world management actions that can be implemented to enhance
biodiversity (e.g. habitat restoration, monitoring, pest eradication). Each
action should have a known cost, and this usually means that each
action should have a defined spatial extent and time period (though this
is not necessary). Conservation projects are groups of management actions
(they can also comprise a singular action too), and each project is
associated with a probability of success if all of its associated actions
are funded. To determine which projects should be funded, each project is
associated with an probability of persistence for the
features that they benefit. These values should indicate the
probability that each feature will persist if only that project funded
and not the additional benefit relative to the baseline project. Missing
(\code{NA}) values should be used to indicate which projects do not
enhance the probability of certain features.

The goal of a project prioritization exercise is then to identify which
management actions---and as a consequence which conservation
projects---should be funded. Broadly speaking, the goal
of an optimization problem is to minimize (or maximize) an objective
function given a set of control variables and decision variables that are
subject to a series of constraints. In the context of project
prioritization problems, the
objective is usually some measure of utility (e.g. the net
probability of each feature persisting into the future), the
control variables determine which actions should be funded or not,
the decision variables contain additional information needed to
ensure correct calculations,  and the
constraints impose limits such as the total budget available for funding
management actions. For more information on the mathematical
formulations used in this package, please refer to the manual entries for
the available objectives (listed in \link{objectives}).
