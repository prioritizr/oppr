\value{
A \code{list} object containing the elements:

\describe{
\item{\code{"projects"}}{A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} containing
the data for the conservation projects. It contains the following
columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{"name"}}{\code{character} name for each project.}
\item{\code{"success"}}{\code{numeric} probability of each project
succeeding if it is funded.}
\item{\code{"F1"} ... \code{"FN"}}{\code{numeric} columns for each
feature, ranging from \code{"F1"} to \code{"FN"} where \code{N}
is the number of features, indicating the enhanced probability that
each feature will persist if it funded. Missing values (\code{NA})
indicate that a feature does not benefit from a project being
funded.}
\item{\code{"F1_action"} ... \code{"FN_action"}}{\code{logical}
columns for each action, ranging from \code{"F1_action"} to
\code{"FN_action"} where \code{N} is
the number of actions (equal to the number of features in this
simulated data), indicating if an action is associated with a
project (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).}
\item{\code{"baseline_action"}}{\code{logical}
column indicating if a project is associated with the baseline
action (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). This action is only
associated with the baseline project.}

\item{\code{"actions"}}{A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} containing
the data for the conservation actions. It contains the following
columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{"name"}}{\code{character} name for each action.}
\item{\code{"cost"}}{\code{numeric} cost for each action.}
\item{\code{"locked_in"}}{\code{logical} indicating if certain
actions should be locked into the solution.}

actions should be locked out of the solution.}

\item{\code{"features"}}{A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} containing
the data for the conservation features (e.g. species). It contains the
following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{"name"}}{\code{character} name for each feature.}
\item{\code{"weight"}}{\code{numeric} weight for each feature.
For each feature, this is calculated as the amount of time that
elapsed between the present and the features' last common ancestor.
In other words, the weights are calculated as the unique amount
of evolutionary history that each feature has experienced.}

\description{
Simulate data for developing project prioritizations for a priority threat
management exercise (Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2019). Here, data are
simulated for a pre-specified number of features, actions, and projects.
Features can benefit from multiple projects, and different projects can
share actions.
}
\details{
The simulated data set will contain one conservation project for
each features, and also a "baseline" (do nothing) project to reflect
features' persistence when their conservation project is not
funded. Each conservation project is associated with a single action, and
no conservation projects share any actions. Specifically, the data are
simulated as follows:

\enumerate{
\item A specified number of conservation projects, features, and
management actions are created.
\item Cost data for each action are simulated using a normal
distribution and the \code{cost_mean} and \code{cost_sd} arguments.
\item A set proportion of the actions are randomly set to be locked
in and out of the solutions using the \code{locked_in_proportion} and
\code{locked_out_proportion} arguments.
\item The probability of each project succeeding if its action is funded
is simulated by drawing probabilities from a uniform distribution with
the upper and lower bounds set as the \code{success_min_probability}
and \code{success_max_probability} arguments.
\item The probability of each feature persisting if various projects
are funded and is successful is simulated by drawing probabilities
from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds set as the
\code{funded_min_persistence_probability} and
\code{funded_max_persistence_probability} arguments. To prevent
\item An additional project is created which represents the "baseline"
(do nothing) scenario. The probability of each feature persisting
when managed under this project is simulated by drawing probabilities
from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds
set as the \code{baseline_min_persistence_probability}
and \code{baseline_max_persistence_probability} arguments.
\item A phylogenetic tree is simulated for the features using
\code{\link[ape:rtree]{ape::rcoal()}}.
\item Feature data are created from the phylogenetic tree. The
weights are calculated as the amount of evolutionary history
that has elapsed between each feature and its last common ancestor.
