\description{
Simulate data for developing project prioritizations for a priority threat
management exercise (Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2019). Here, data are
simulated for a pre-specified number of features, actions, and projects.
Features can benefit from multiple projects, and different projects can
share actions.
}
\details{
The simulated data set will contain one conservation project for
  each features, and also a "baseline" (do nothing) project to reflect
  features' persistence when their conservation project is not
  funded. Each conservation project is associated with a single action, and
  no conservation projects share any actions. Specifically, the data are
  simulated as follows:

  \enumerate{

    \item A specified number of conservation projects, features, and
      management actions are created.

    \item Cost data for each action are simulated using a normal
      distribution and the \code{cost_mean} and \code{cost_sd} arguments.

    \item A set proportion of the actions are randomly set to be locked
      in and out of the solutions using the \code{locked_in_proportion} and
      \code{locked_out_proportion} arguments.

    \item The probability of each project succeeding if its action is funded
      is simulated by drawing probabilities from a uniform distribution with
      the upper and lower bounds set as the \code{success_min_probability}
      and \code{success_max_probability} arguments.

    \item The probability of each feature persisting if various projects
      are funded and is successful is simulated by drawing probabilities
      from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds set as the
      \code{funded_min_persistence_probability} and
      \code{funded_max_persistence_probability} arguments. To prevent

    \item An additional project is created which represents the "baseline"
      (do nothing) scenario. The probability of each feature persisting
      when managed under this project is simulated by drawing probabilities
      from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds
      set as the \code{baseline_min_persistence_probability}
      and \code{baseline_max_persistence_probability} arguments.

    \item A phylogenetic tree is simulated for the features using
      \code{\link[ape]{rcoal}}.

    \item Feature data are created from the phylogenetic tree. The
      weights are calculated as the amount of evolutionary history
      that has elapsed between each feature and its last common ancestor.
