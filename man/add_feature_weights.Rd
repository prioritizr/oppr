\description{
Set weights for conserving features in a project prioritization
\code{\link{problem}}.
}
\details{
Weights are used to specify the relative importance for
  maintaining the persistence of specific features. For budget constrained
  problems (e.g. \code{\link{add_max_richness_objective}}), these
  weights
  could be used to specify which features are more important than other
  features according to evolutionary or cultural metrics. Specifically,
  features with a higher weight value are considered more important. It is
  generally best to ensure that the feature weights range between 0.0001 and
  10,000 to reduce the time required to solve problems using exact
  algorithm solvers. As a consequence, you might have to rescale the feature
  weights if the largest or smallest values occur outside this range
  (excluding zeros). If you want to ensure that certain features conserved
  in the solutions, it is strongly recommended to lock in the actions for
  these features instead of setting really high weights for these features.
  Please note that a warning will be thrown if you attempt to solve
  problems with weights when an objective has been specified that does
  not use weights. Currently, all objectives---except for the minimum
  set objective (i.e. \code{\link{add_min_set_objective}})---can use weights.

  The weights for a problem can be specified in several different ways:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{numeric}}{\code{vector} of weight values for each feature.}

  \item{\code{character}}{specifying the name of column in the
    feature data (i.e. the argument to \code{features} in the
    \code{\link{problem}} function) that contains the weights.}

  }
}
\examples{
# load data
data(sim_projects, sim_features, sim_actions)

# print feature data
print(sim_features)

# build problem with maximum richness objective, $300 budget, and no weights
p1 <- problem(sim_projects, sim_actions, sim_features,
              "name", "success", "name", "cost", "name") \%>\%
      add_max_richness_objective(budget = 200) \%>\%
      add_binary_decisions()

# print problem
print(p1)

# build another problem, and specify feature weights using the values in the
# "weight" column of the sim_features table by specifying the column
# name "weight"
p2 <- p1 \%>\%
      add_feature_weights("weight")

# print problem
print(p2)

# build another problem, and specify feature weights using the
# values in the "weight column of the sim_features table, but
# actually input the values rather than specifying the column name
# "weights" column of the sim_features table
p3 <- p1 \%>\%
      add_feature_weights(sim_features$weight)

# print problem
print(p3)

\donttest{
# solve the problems
s1 <- solve(p1)
s2 <- solve(p2)
s3 <- solve(p3)

# print solutions
print(s1)
print(s2)
print(s3)

# plot solutions
plot(p1, s1)
plot(p2, s2)
plot(p3, s3)
