\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum probability of persistence required
for each feature. Please note that only some objectives require
targets, and attempting to solve a problem that requires targets will throw
an error if targets are not supplied, and attempting to solve a problem that
does not require targets will throw a warning if targets are supplied.
}
\details{
The following functions can be used to specify targets for a
project prioritization \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}:

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_relative_targets]{add_relative_targets()}}}{
Set targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the maximum probability
of persistence associated with the best project for each feature. For
instance, if the best project for a feature has an 80\% probability of
persisting, setting a 50\% (i.e. \code{0.5}) relative target will
correspond to a 40\% threshold probability of persisting.}

\item{\code{\link[=add_absolute_targets]{add_absolute_targets()}}}{
Set targets by specifying exactly what probability of persistence is
required for each feature. For instance, setting an absolute target of
10\% (i.e. \code{0.1}) corresponds to a threshold 10\% probability of
persisting.}

\item{\code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}}}{
Set targets by manually specifying all the required information for each
target.}

}
