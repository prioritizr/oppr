\usage{
\S4method{solve}{OptimizationProblem,Solver}(a, b, ...)

\S4method{solve}{ProjectProblem,missing}(a, b, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{\linkS4class{ProjectProblem} or an
\linkS4class{OptimizationProblem} object.}

\item{b}{\linkS4class{Solver} object. Not used if \code{a} is an
\linkS4class{ProjectProblem} object.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link[=compile]{compile()}}.}
}
\value{
The type of object returned from this function depends on the
argument to \code{a}. If the argument to \code{a} is an
\linkS4class{OptimizationProblem} object, then the
solution is returned as a \code{list} containing the prioritization and
additional information (e.g. run time, solver status). On the other hand,
if the argument
to \code{a} is an \linkS4class{ProjectProblem} object,
then a \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} table object will be returned. In this
table, each row row corresponds to a different solution and each column
describes a different property or result associated with each solution:

\describe{

\item{\code{"solution"}}{\code{integer} solution identifier.}

\item{\code{"status"}}{\code{character} describing each solution.
For example, is the solution optimal, suboptimal, or was it returned
because the solver ran out of time?}

\item{\code{"obj"}}{\code{numeric} objective value for each solution.
This is calculated using the objective function defined for the
argument to \code{x}.}

\item{\code{"cost"}}{\code{numeric} total cost associated with each
solution.}

\item{\code{x$action_names()}}{\code{numeric} column for each action
indicating if they were funded in each solution or not.}

\item{\code{x$project_names()}}{\code{numeric} column for each
project indicating if it was completely funded (with a value of 1)
or not (with a value of 0).}

\item{\code{x$feature_names()}}{\code{numeric} column for each
feature indicating the probability that it will persist into
the future given each solution.}
