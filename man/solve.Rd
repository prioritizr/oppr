\usage{
\S4method{solve}{OptimizationProblem,Solver}(a, b, ...)

\S4method{solve}{ProjectProblem,missing}(a, b, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{\code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} or an
\code{\link{OptimizationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{b}{\code{\link{Solver-class}} object. Not used if \code{a} is an
\code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} object.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link{compile}}.}
}
\value{
The type of object returned from this function depends on the
  argument to \code{a}. If the argument to \code{a} is an
  \code{\link{OptimizationProblem-class}} object, then the
  solution is returned as a \code{list} containing the prioritization and
  additional information (e.g. run time, solver status). On the other hand,
  if the argument
  to \code{a} is an \code{\link{ProjectProblem-class}} object,
  then a \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} table object will be returned. In this
  table, each row row corresponds to a different solution and each column
  describes a different property or result associated with each solution:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{"solution"}}{\code{integer} solution identifier.}

  \item{\code{"status"}}{\code{character} describing each solution.
   For example, is the solution optimal, suboptimal, or was it returned
   because the solver ran out of time?}

  \item{\code{"obj"}}{\code{numeric} objective value for each solution.
    This is calculated using the objective function defined for the
    argument to \code{x}.}

  \item{\code{"cost"}}{\code{numeric} total cost associated with each
    solution.}

  \item{\code{x$action_names()}}{\code{numeric} column for each action
    indicating if they were funded in each solution or not.}

  \item{\code{x$project_names()}}{\code{numeric} column for each
    project indicating if it was completely funded (with a value of 1)
    or not (with a value of 0).}

  \item{\code{x$feature_names()}}{\code{numeric} column for each
    feature indicating the probability that it will persist into
    the future given each solution.}
