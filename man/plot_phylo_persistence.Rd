\usage{
plot_phylo_persistence(
  x,
  solution,
  n = 1,
  symbol_hjust = 0.007,
  return_data = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{project prioritization \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.}

\item{solution}{\code{\link[base:data.frame]{base::data.frame()}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} table containing the solutions. Here,
rows correspond to different solutions and columns correspond to
different actions. Each column in the argument to \code{solution} should
be named according to a different action in \code{x}.
Cell values indicate if an action is funded in a given solution or not,
and should be either zero or one. Arguments to \code{solution} can
contain additional columns, and they will be ignored.}

\item{n}{\code{integer} solution number to visualize.
Since each row in the argument to \code{solutions} corresponds to a
different solution, this argument should correspond to a row in
the argument to \code{solutions}. Defaults to 1.}

\item{symbol_hjust}{\code{numeric} horizontal adjustment parameter to
manually align the asterisks and dashes in the plot. Defaults to
\code{0.007}. Increasing this parameter will shift the symbols further
right. Please note that this parameter may require some tweaking
to produce visually appealing publication quality plots.}

\item{return_data}{\code{logical} should the underlying data used to create
the plot be returned instead of the plot? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[ggtree:ggtree]{ggtree::ggtree()}} object, or a
\code{\link[tidytree:treedata]{tidytree::treedata()}} object if \code{return_data} is
\code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Create a plot showing a phylogenetic tree (i.e. a "phylogram") to visualize
the probability that phylogenetic branches are expected to persist
into the future under a solution to a project prioritization \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}
\details{
This function requires the \pkg{ggtree} (Yu \emph{et al.} 2017).
Since this package is distributed exclusively
through \href{https://bioconductor.org}{Bioconductor}, and is not
available on the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{Comprehensive R Archive Network},
please execute the following command to install it:
\verb{source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");biocLite("ggtree")}.
If the installation process fails, please consult the package's \href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html}{online documentation}.

In this plot, each phylogenetic branch is colored according to probability
that it is expected to persist into the future (see Faith 2008).
Features that directly benefit from at least a single
completely funded project with a non-zero cost are depicted with an
asterisk symbol. Additionally, features that indirectly benefit from funded
projects---because they are associated with partially funded projects that
have non-zero costs and share actions with at least one completely funded
project---are depicted with an open circle symbol.
