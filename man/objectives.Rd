\title{Problem objective}
\description{
An objective is used to specify the overall goal of a project prioritization
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}. All project prioritization problems involve
minimizing or maximizing some kind of objective. For instance, the decision
maker may require a funding scheme that maximizes the total number of
species that are expected to persist into the future whilst ensuring that
the total cost of the funded actions does not exceed a budget.
Alternatively, the planner may require a solution that ensures that
each species meets a target level of persistence whilst minimizing the cost
of  the funded actions. A project prioritization
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} \strong{must} have a specified objective before it can
be solved, and attempting to solve a problem which does not have
a specified objective will throw an error.
}
\details{
The following objectives can be added to a conservation planning
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}:

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_max_richness_objective]{add_max_richness_objective()}}}{
Maximize the total number of features that are expected to persist,
whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified
budget (Joseph, Maloney & Possingham 2009).}

\item{\code{\link[=add_max_targets_met_objective]{add_max_targets_met_objective()}}}{
Maximize the total number of persistence targets met for the features,
whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified
budget (Chades \emph{et al.} 2015).}

\item{\code{\link[=add_max_phylo_div_objective]{add_max_phylo_div_objective()}}}{
Maximize the phylogenetic diversity that is expected to persist into the
future, whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a
pre-specified budget (Bennett \emph{et al.} 2014, Faith 2008).}

\item{\code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}}}{
Minimize the cost of the solution whilst ensuring that all targets are
met. This objective is conceptually similar to that used in \emph{Marxan}
(Ball, Possingham & Watts 2009).}
