\title{oppr: Optimal Project Prioritization}
\description{
The \pkg{oppr} \emph{R} package a decision support tool for prioritizing
conservation projects. Prioritizations can be developed by maximizing
expected feature richness, expected
phylogenetic diversity, the number of features that meet persistence
targets, or identifying a set of projects that meet persistence targets
for minimal cost. Constraints (e.g. lock in
specific actions) and feature weights can also be specified to further
customize prioritizations. After defining a project prioritization
problem, solutions can be obtained using exact algorithms, heuristic
algorithms, or random processes. In particular, it is recommended to
install the 'Gurobi' optimizer (available from
\url{https://www.gurobi.com})
because it can identify optimal solutions very quickly. Finally, methods
are provided for comparing different prioritizations and evaluating their
benefits.

\section{Installation}{

To make the most of this package, the \href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html}{\pkg{ggtree}} and
\href{https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/refman/r_api_overview.html}{\pkg{gurobi}} R packages will need to be installed.
Since the \href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html}{\pkg{ggtree}} package is exclusively available
at \href{https://bioconductor.org}{Bioconductor}---and is not available on
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{The Comprehensive R Archive Network}---please
execute the following command to install it:
\verb{source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");biocLite("ggtree")}.
If the installation process fails, please consult the
\href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html}{package's online documentation}. To install the \pkg{gurobi} package, the
\href{https://www.gurobi.com}{Gurobi} optimization suite will first need to
be installed (see \url{https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4534161999889-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-Optimizer} for instructions). Although
\href{https://www.gurobi.com}{Gurobi} is a commercial software, academics
can obtain a
\href{https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/}{special license for no cost}. After installing the
\href{https://www.gurobi.com}{Gurobi} optimization suite, the \pkg{gurobi}
package can then be installed (see \url{https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/r_ins_the_r_package.html} for instructions).

# solve problem

# print output
print(s)

# print which actions are funded in the solution
s[, sim_actions$name, drop = FALSE]

# print the expected probability of persistence for each feature
# if the solution were implemented
s[, sim_features$name, drop = FALSE]

# visualize solution
