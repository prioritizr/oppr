\description{
Project prioritization problems involve making decisions about
how funding will be allocated to management actions.
}
\details{
Please note that only one type of decision is currently supported:

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_binary_decisions]{add_binary_decisions()}}}{
This is the conventional type of decision where management actions are
either prioritized for funding or not.}

}
}
\examples{
# load data
data(sim_projects, sim_features, sim_actions)

# build problem with maximum richness objective, $200 budget, and
# binary decisions
p <- problem(sim_projects, sim_actions, sim_features,
             "name", "success", "name", "cost", "name") \%>\%
     add_max_richness_objective(budget = 200) \%>\%
     add_binary_decisions()

# print problem
print(p)

\dontrun{
# solve problem
s <- solve(p)

# print solution
print(s)

# plot solution
plot(p, s)
