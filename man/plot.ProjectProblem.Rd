\title{Plot a solution to a project prioritization problem}
\usage{
\method{plot}{ProjectProblem}(x, solution, n = 1, symbol_hjust = 0.007, return_data = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{project prioritization \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.}

\item{solution}{\code{\link[base:data.frame]{base::data.frame()}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} table containing the solutions. Here,
rows correspond to different solutions and columns correspond to
different actions. Each column in the argument to \code{solution} should
be named according to a different action in \code{x}.
Cell values indicate if an action is funded in a given solution or not,
and should be either zero or one. Arguments to \code{solution} can
contain additional columns, and they will be ignored.}

\item{n}{\code{integer} solution number to visualize.
Since each row in the argument to \code{solutions} corresponds to a
different solution, this argument should correspond to a row in
the argument to \code{solutions}. Defaults to 1.}

\item{symbol_hjust}{\code{numeric} horizontal adjustment parameter to
manually align the asterisks and dashes in the plot. Defaults to
\code{0.007}. Increasing this parameter will shift the symbols further
right. Please note that this parameter may require some tweaking
to produce visually appealing publication quality plots.}

\item{return_data}{\code{logical} should the underlying data used to create
the plot be returned instead of the plot? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{not used.}

\value{
A \code{\link[=ggplot]{ggplot()}} object.

\description{
Create a plot to visualize how well a solution to a project prioritization
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} will maintain biodiversity.
}
\details{
The type of plot that this function creates depends on the
problem objective. If the problem objective contains phylogenetic data,
then this function plots a phylogenetic tree where each branch
is colored according to its probability of persistence. Otherwise,
if the problem does not contain phylogenetic data, then this function
creates a bar plot where each bar corresponds to a different feature.
The height of the bars indicate each feature's probability of
persistence, and the width of the bars indicate each feature's weight.

Features that directly benefit from at least a single
completely funded project with a non-zero cost are depicted with an
asterisk symbol. Additionally, features that indirectly benefit from funded
projects---because they are associated with partially funded projects that
have non-zero costs and share actions with at least one funded
project---are depicted with an open circle symbol.

This function is essentially a wrapper for
\code{\link[=plot_feature_persistence]{plot_feature_persistence()}} and
\code{\link[=plot_phylo_persistence]{plot_phylo_persistence()}}, so refer to the documentation
for these functions for more information.
