# Add a *SYMPHONY* solver with *Rsymphony*

Add a solver to generate solutions to a project prioritization problem
with the *SYMPHONY* software via the Rsymphony package. This function
can also be used to customize the behavior of the solver. It requires
the Rsymphony package to be installed.

## Usage

``` r
add_rsymphony_solver(
  x,
  gap = 0,
  time_limit = .Machine$integer.max,
  first_feasible = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  [`problem()`](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/reference/problem.md)
  or
  [`multi_problem()`](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/reference/multi_problem.md)
  object.

- gap:

  `numeric` gap to optimality. This gap is relative and expresses the
  acceptable deviance from the optimal objective. For example, a value
  of 0.01 will result in the solver stopping when it has found a
  solution within 1% of optimality. Additionally, a value of 0 will
  result in the solver stopping when it has found an optimal solution.
  The default value is 0 (i.e., 0% from optimality).

- time_limit:

  `numeric` time limit in seconds to run the optimizer. The solver will
  return the current best solution when this time limit is exceeded.

- first_feasible:

  `logical` should the first feasible solution be be returned? If
  `first_feasible` is set to `TRUE`, the solver will return the first
  solution it encounters that meets all the constraints, regardless of
  solution quality. Note that the first feasible solution is not an
  arbitrary solution, rather it is derived from the relaxed solution,
  and is therefore often reasonably close to optimality. Defaults to
  `FALSE`.

- verbose:

  `logical` should information be printed during optimization? Defaults
  to `TRUE`.

## Value

A [`problem()`](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/reference/problem.md)
object with the solver added to it.

## Details

[*SYMPHONY*](https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY) is an open-source
integer programming solver that is part of the Computational
Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) project, an initiative
to promote development of open-source tools for operations research (a
field that includes linear programming). The Rsymphony package provides
an interface to COIN-OR and is available on *CRAN*. This solver uses the
Rsymphony package to solve problems.
